# dev-machine

This project is a Rakefile that will setup a development machine from scratch.

The development setup turns around the holy trinity:

- zsh
- vim
- tmux
- iterm2 (not part of the trinity, but welcomed)

It will also link dotfiles.

### Installation

```
rake
```

## TODO
### tmux

Remember to install Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm) and run `prefix + I` to install the plugins listed in `.tmux.conf`. This doesn't exist yet in this repository.
